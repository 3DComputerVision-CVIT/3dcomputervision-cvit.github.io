I am Dr Avinash Sharma, an associate professor at [CSE department in Indian Institute of Technology, Jodphur (IITJ)](https://cse.iitj.ac.in/). Previously, I was affiliated with [Centre for Visual Information Technology (CVIT)](https://cvit.iiit.ac.in) at IIIT Hyderabad for eight years. Prior to this, I was a Research Scientist at Xerox Research Center India. I graduated with MS by Research in Computer Vision from IIIT-H and PhD in Applied Mathematics from INP Grenoble and INRIA Rhone-Alpes. I have been recently awarded the Google Faculty Award on two separate occasions. 

Here at CSE@IITJ, I am building a large [group](/group) of students whose research is inclined towards 3D computer vision, AR/VR and Graphics.
