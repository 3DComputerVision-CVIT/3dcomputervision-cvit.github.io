This is a research group led by [Dr Avinash Sharma](/about/), who has recently moved to [Computer Science & Engineering](https://cse.iitj.ac.in/) department at IIT Jodhpur as an associate professor while continuing his affiliation with [Centre for Visual Information Technology (CVIT)](http://cvit.iiit.ac.in), IIIT Hyderabad. We primarily work on the computer vision and machine learning problems with a focus on 3D scene understanding and reconstruction. Specifically, we deal with problems where human body is reconstructed from 2D images and analysed in 3D, generation & analysis of  3D terrains, registration of point clouds of indoor scenes captured from commodity sensors as well as large outdoor scenes captured from LIDAR scanners.  

<span style="color:orange">
We are looking for motivated PhD students and long-term RAs/interns with interest in 3D computer vision to join us. </span>Please check [here](/openings) for more details.
